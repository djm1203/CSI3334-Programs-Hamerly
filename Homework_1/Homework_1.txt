-----1. 
	a) Answer for 5: 5
	   Answer for 10: 55
	   Answer for 20: 6765
	b) No it does not finish in a reasonable time, it has a O(2^n)
	c) The program is written well as it is concise and easy to follow the code. It clearly
	displays the equation for the fibonacci sequence.
	d) As for negative parts of the code, considering the O(2^n) it is exponential and for large
	numbers in n it will take a long time to execute the code. Which can also lead to stack
	overflow when it comes to large n values and the recursive calls

-----2. Yes, the runtime stack might run out of space, due to a exponential growth of the function.

-----3. Slowest --> Fastest Growing
